This repository contains a simple C program that demonstrates a common error: undefined behavior arising from pointer arithmetic beyond allocated memory. The bug.c file showcases the problematic code. The bugSolution.c file presents the corrected version, highlighting the importance of careful pointer manipulation and memory management in C programming. The primary issue is the lack of boundary checks and error handling around pointer operations, leading to unpredictable program behavior and potential crashes.
